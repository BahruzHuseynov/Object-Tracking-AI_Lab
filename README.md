It is a research based project in which object detection, segmentation, and tracking algorithms focusing on LEGO bricks in real-world video recordings are used. Using YOLOv8 and RT-DETR models for the detection, DeepLabv3 for semantic segmentation and DeepSORT for tracking, the research evaluates performance in building an object counter.

## Prerequisites
- Creation of the virtual environment is recommended


## Using this project

## Dataset
In this research, the dataset was manually created using a smartphone, consisting of 12 videos â€” 10 for training and 2 for testing. These videos capture conveyor belts with LEGO bricks from multiple angles with varying complexities for diversity. LEGO bricks were annotated frame-by-frame using RoboFlow (https://roboflow.com/), which was the most time-consuming step. Dataset is publicly available in kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hbahruz/multiple-lego-tracking-dataset
