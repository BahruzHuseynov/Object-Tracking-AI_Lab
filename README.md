It is a research based project in which object detection, segmentation, and tracking algorithms focusing on LEGO bricks in real-world video recordings are used. Using YOLOv8 and RT-DETR models for the detection, DeepLabv3 for semantic segmentation and DeepSORT for tracking, the research evaluates performance in building an object counter. <b> For the detailed information, you can read the report. </b>

## Google Colab <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSArk3D34rWqNoPw4_n-ovyK0lz3yvknTVZd9yeCdZrsdDEViqoPMmjhFWD-iy4NO1UiyI&usqp=CAU" alt="Colab" width="40">
- To train or fine-tune detection and segmentation models, usage of GPU is recommended.
- During research, codes have been executed in Google Colab as it is a hosted Jupyter Notebook service that provides free access to computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs.

## Dataset
- In this research, the dataset was manually created using a smartphone, consisting of 12 videos â€” 10 for training and 2 for testing. These videos capture conveyor belts with LEGO bricks from multiple angles with varying complexities for diversity. LEGO bricks were annotated frame-by-frame using RoboFlow (https://roboflow.com/), which was the most time-consuming step.
- Dataset is publicly available in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hbahruz/multiple-lego-tracking-dataset
